      I'm a 25 year old software developer. I have experience building full
      stack web applications on several cross functional teams primarily with
      JavaScript and Python, using technologies such as React, Redux, Node.js,
      Express, Django, PostgreSQL, Apollo, and GraphQL.

      Outside of programming you might find me reading a book or spending time
      with my two dogs.
